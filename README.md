# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me do a small introduction of myself.  
Currently, I'm a Software Engineer working on Azure at Microsoft.

During my day job, I spend a lot of time in Azure.   
In my spare time, I try to expand my horizon by trying out stuff in Azure or in the .NET space which I don't have time to play around with during the day.

Feel free to contact me over here or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jan-v.nl) or on my [blog](https://jan-v.nl/).
