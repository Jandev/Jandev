# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me do a small introduction of myself.  
Currently, I'm a Cloud Solution Architect working at a medium-sized consulting firm called [4Dotnet](https://www.4dotnet.nl/).

During my day job, I spend a lot of time in Azure. Doing migration from on-premises, expanding cloud solutions, and making sure the solutions fit the customer needs.  
In my spare time, I try to expand my horizon by trying out stuff in Azure or in the .NET space which I don't have time to play around with during the day.

Feel free to contact me over here or on Twitter or on my [blog](https://jan-v.nl/).
You can also find me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jandev) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLfd7HBMLYJ0Muou1ihl_DA) where I'll be streaming and posting videos regularly.
